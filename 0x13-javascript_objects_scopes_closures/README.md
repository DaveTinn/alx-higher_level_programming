# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

*Objects*
In JavaScript, objects are one of the most fundamental data structures, allowing you to store data in key-value pairs.

*Scope*
Scope in JavaScript refers to the visibility and lifetime of variables and functions.
JavaScript has function-level scope, meaning variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function.

*Closures*
Closures are powerful and a concept often misunderstood in JavaScript.
A closure is a function that has access to its outer function's scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Summarily, JavaScript's object-oriented nature, combined with its flexible scoping rules and support for closures, makes it a powerful and versatile programming language for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
